#Data Types: Python has several built-in data types that are used to represent different types of data. The data types are classified into two categories:
age = 10
marks = 10.0
greeting = "Hello"
full_name = "Venkat Reyaansh"
is_student = True
print(f"Age: {age}, Marks: {marks}, Greeting: {greeting}, Full Name: {full_name}, Is Student: {is_student}")
print(type(age))
