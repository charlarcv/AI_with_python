#Variables:
x = 10
name = "Venkat"
print(x)
print(name)


#Data Types: Python has several built-in data types that are used to represent different types of data. The data types are classified into two categories:
age = 10
marks = 10.0
greeting = "Hello"
full_name = "Venkat Reyaansh"
is_student = True
print(f"Age: {age}, Marks: {marks}, Greeting: {greeting}, Full Name: {full_name}, Is Student: {is_student}")
print(type(age))

# Type casting
x = 5
y = float(x) # Convert x to float
print(y)


# Checking Data Types:
x = 10
print(type(x))



# Exercise and practice:
#Simple Math Operations
x = 10
y = 20
add = x + y
mul = x * y
div = x / y
sub = x - y

# String Manipulation
first_name = "Venkat"
last_name = "Reyaansh"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(f"Full Name: {full_name}" + " {0} {1} ".format(first_name, last_name))

# Type Checking
x = 10
print(type(x))
